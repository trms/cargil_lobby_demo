This is a wayfinding app built with Laravel PHP and Ember.js
It requires PHP 5.4+, MySql and Composer to be installed

PHP extensions required -- mcrypt, openssl, mbstring, tokenizer, fileinfo


It allows for 'locations' to be tied to 'listings' of people or businesses.  Each listing has other available information fields like name phone number email etc. Each location can have multiple 'kiosks' associated with it, these are added in an array inside the ember application controller and then referenced by a url query parameter 'kiosk'. The default is 1.

# example:  
kiosk: [1,2] 

to reference kiosk 2 the url should be 'http://localhost:4200?kiosk=2'






# Database
the database name should be AWSA_wayfinding

# Installation

`composer update`
`php artisan migrate:install`
`php artisan migrate`

then restore database from backup

#Development
follow the above steps with an optional `php artisan db:seed` to seed the database with dummy data

`php artisan serve --host 0.0.0.0` will serve a local instance of laravel on port 8000

#in app_front_end

`npm install`
`bower install`
`ember server --proxy http://localhost:8000`

your application will now be running on localhost:4200

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
